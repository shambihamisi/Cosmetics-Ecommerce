**Cosmetics E-Commerce Web Application**

This project is a modern cosmetics e-commerce web application built to provide a smooth and elegant shopping experience. Users can browse curated beauty products, view detailed product pages, manage a shopping cart, and proceed through a streamlined checkout flow.

The application focuses on clean UI design, responsive layouts, and intuitive user interactions. It is built with React and Tailwind CSS, using reusable components and Context API for global state management.

The project is frontend-complete and backend-ready, meaning it is structured to easily integrate with a real API, database, authentication system, and payment services.
